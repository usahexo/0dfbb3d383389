However, some hands are better than others. In this article, we will take a look at the seven best poker hands and how to play them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Royal Flush: The royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of the five highest ranking cards in the same suit. For example, if you are playing with a deck of cards that has suits of clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, then the five cards would have to be Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten of that same suit. This hand is extremely rare and usually only happens once in every 40,000 hands or so. Because of its rarity, the royal flush should be played aggressively whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straight Flush: A straight flush is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, if you are playing with a deck of cards that has suits of clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, then the five cards would have to be 2 3 4 5 (of any suit). This hand is also very rare and should be played aggressively when possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four Of A Kind: A four of a kind is a hand that consists of four cards of the same rank and one random card. For example, if you are playing with a deck of cards that has suits of clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades ,then the four cards would have to be Ace 2 3 4 (of any suit). Generally speaking, this hand should be played aggressively unless there is a very good reason not to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Full House: A full house is a hand that consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For example, if you are playing with a deck of cards that has suits of clubs, diamonds ,hearts ,spades ,then the three cards would have to be Ace 2 3 (of any suit) and the two other cards would have to be any other rank (10 11 12 for example). This hand can generally be played either aggressively or passively depending on what is going on at the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flush: A flush is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit .For example ,if you are playing with a deck</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>of </p>
<p>cards that has suits Clubs Diamon Hearts Spades then all 5 consecutives suited-cards will make up your “flush”. This type Hand usually isn’t as strong as some others but can still hold it’s own against many adversaries– Play this Hand aggresively when needed!.<br>6) Straight: A straight is formed when five consecutive non-suited Cards come together.. eg 6 7 8 9 10 Club-Diamond-Heart-Spade ). It’s generally advisable to play most straights passively UNLESS an opponent overplays their weaker not as strong Straight..Then take advantage!<br>7) Three Of A Kind: Consisting off 3 Cards having matching Rank but different suits (e.g.: 3 ♥♥♥♦♦ ) As with most Hands–Play aggresively when possible!</p>
