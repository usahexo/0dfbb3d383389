      		<h1 id="How-to-dominate-the-National-League-Central-betting-landscape"><a href="#How-to-dominate-the-National-League-Central-betting-landscape" class="headerlink" title="How to dominate the National League Central betting landscape"></a>How to dominate the National League Central betting landscape</h1><p>The National League Central has been one of the most unpredictable divisions in baseball in recent years. No team has won back-to-back division titles since the St. Louis Cardinals did it in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>The 2016 season was a perfect example, as the division champion Chicago Cubs finished with just a .500 record. This season, however, the Cubs are once again the favorites to win the NL Central, with odds of -175 at BetOnline.</p>
<p>Here is a look at how each team in the division stacks up heading into the 2018 season:</p>
<p>Chicago Cubs - The Cubs still have one of the best lineups in baseball, and they added Yu Darvish to their rotation this offseason. They’re also still very strong defensively.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Brewers - The Brewers made some big additions this offseason, including Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain. They could be a sleeper team this year.</p>
<p>St. Louis Cardinals - The Cardinals are always competitive, but they’re likely not good enough to unseat the Cubs this year.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Pirates - The Pirates have been rebuilding over the past few years, and they still have a ways to go before they’re competitive again.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Reds - The Reds are probably the weakest team in the division and should finish near the bottom of the standings.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-killing-betting-on-NL-Central-baseball"><a href="#How-to-make-a-killing-betting-on-NL-Central-baseball" class="headerlink" title="How to make a killing betting on NL Central baseball"></a>How to make a killing betting on NL Central baseball</h1><p>The National League Central is one of the most competitive divisions in baseball, with six teams all capable of making the playoffs. The Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, and Chicago Cubs are all teams that could potentially make a run at the division title.</p>
<p>The NL Central is also a great division to bet on, as the odds are usually very close and there are a lot of games that can be bet on. In this article, we will take a look at how to make a killing betting on NL Central baseball.</p>
<p>The key to betting on NL Central baseball is to know which teams are good bets and which teams are not. The Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals are all good bets most of the time, while the Chicago Cubs are not always a good bet.</p>
<p>One way to make money betting on NL Central baseball is to bet against the Cubs when they are playing bad teams. For example, the Cubs were recently upset by the Miami Marlins, who entered that game with a record of 16-37. As a result, it would have been a smart move to bet on the Marlins in that game.</p>
<p>It is also important to pay attention to how well each team is playing heading into a particular series. For example, if the Reds are coming off a series where they won two out of three games, they would be considered favorites in their next series against the Brewers even though Milwaukee has been playing better lately.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when betting on NL Central baseball is that value is key. It’s not always wise to simply bet on the favorite; sometimes there is value in betting on the underdog. As long as you do your research and understand what each team is capable of doing, you should be able to make a lot of money betting on NL Central baseball.</p>

<p>#2 The Cardinals are always contenders</p>
