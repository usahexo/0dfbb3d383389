Individual taxpayers may deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of their gambling winnings. To claim your gambling losses on your return, you must keep track of all of your gambling activity during the year.

There are two ways to report your gambling losses:

You can deduct your losses as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A. This option is available if you itemize your deductions. You can take the standard deduction and write off your gambling losses on Line 28 of Form 1040. This option is available if you don’t itemize deductions.

In order to claim your losses for the year, you will need to fill out Form 1040, Schedule A, and/or Form 1040, Schedule G. You will also need to provide proof of your winnings and losses. For example, you can provide documentation such as receipts, tickets, cancelled checks, or statements from the casino or other gaming establishment.

#  Turbotax And Gambling Losses

In the past, if you itemized your deductions on your tax return, you could deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. This was changed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) signed into law in December 2017. Starting in 2018, you can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling income.

The new law does not specifically address whether or not you can still deduct gambling losses if you don’t itemize deductions. The general rule is that you cannot deduct expenses for personal activities unless you itemize deductions. So it appears that, starting in 2018, you cannot deduct your gambling losses if you take the standard deduction on your tax return.

If you do itemize deductions, you can continue to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. However, if your total itemized deductions are less than the standard deduction, you will lose the benefit of itemizing and may want to reconsider claiming any gambling-related losses.
