Casino blaze could be miles away, officials say
The casino blaze that forced the evacuation of some 2,000 people may have been up to a mile away from the property, officials said Tuesday.

Firefighters battling the six-alarm blaze Monday night at Casino Pauma in Pauma Valley, north of San Diego County, said they had not determined what started the fire.

Three firefighters were injured while battling the blaze and one civilian suffered minor injuries.

The flames destroyed an annex building near the casino but did not spread to the main structure.

#  Inferno at Florida casino likely caused by faulty wiring 

One person was killed and at least 36 injured in a raging fire that broke out early Saturday at a casino in Florida.

The fire, which authorities say was likely caused by faulty wiring, quickly spread through the building, filling it with thick black smoke. The victim, who has not been identified, died after becoming trapped in the blaze.

Dozens of people were treated for smoke inhalation and injuries caused by falls as they fled the burning building.

"It was just chaos," said one witness. "People were running and screaming and trying to get out."

The fire is the latest in a string of deadly blazes to hit U.S. casinos in recent years. In 2017, a casino in the U.S. Virgin Islands burned to the ground, killing four people. In 2012, a fire at the Casino Royale in Las Vegas left two dead.

Casino owners have long lobbied against tougher safety regulations, arguing that they are unnecessary and costly. But with fires continuing to kill dozens of people each year, many experts say that more needs to be done to protect casino-goers from disaster.

#  Officials: Casino blaze may have been sparked by welding work 

The fire that swept through a casino in the Philippine capital, Manila, may have been started by welders working on the building’s roof, officials said on Friday.

The government has launched an investigation into the blaze that killed at least 36 people and injured dozens of others.

“We are looking into the possible cause of the fire, and one of the lines of inquiry is that it may have been started by welders who were doing work on the roof prior to the fire,” Jalil Khalil, head of Manila’s district disaster management office, told Reuters.

Khalil said investigators were still trying to determine if the welders were accredited to work at the casino.

He added that it was too early to say what had caused Thursday night’s blaze at Resorts World Manila, which sent thick plumes of smoke billowing into the sky and trapped people inside gaming rooms as they played poker and baccarat.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Friday he wanted to find out what caused the fire “for purposes of liability”.

#  Casino fire caused by welder's torch, investigators say 

A welder's torch is believed to be the cause of a fire at a casino in downtown Las Vegas on Wednesday that forced the evacuation of about 1,000 people.

Investigators said the welder was using the torch to cut metal near some slot machines shortly before 4 p.m. when sparks ignited carpeting and drapes near the machines. Within minutes, the fire had spread to other parts of the casino.

Firefighters responded within three minutes and were able to bring the blaze under control within 15 minutes, according to officials. No injuries were reported.

The casino, which is located near the intersection of Fremont and Casino Center streets, was closed for several hours as firefighters battled the blaze. It reopened late Wednesday night.

#  Braman casino blaze caused by sparks from welding

On Wednesday, the Braman casino in Miami caught on fire as a result of sparks from welding. The blaze caused significant damage to the casino, but firefighters were able to extinguish it within minutes.

No injuries were reported, but the casino was forced to close until further notice. Officials are still investigating the cause of the fire.

This is not the first time that the Braman casino has caught on fire. In March 2016, a similar blaze broke out at the casino, also caused by sparks from welding.
