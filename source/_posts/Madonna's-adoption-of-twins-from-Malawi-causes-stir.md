#  Madonna's adoption of twins from Malawi causes stir

Recently, American singer and songwriter Madonna announced her intention to adopt two more children from Malawi. This has caused a stir in the public, with some people lauding her decision and others criticizing it.

Madonna is no stranger to adoption; she has previously adopted children from both Malawi and the United States. Her latest decision to adopt two more children from Malawi has been met with a mixed reaction, with some people arguing that she is doing a good deed by providing homes for orphans, while others claim that she is exploiting the system and taking advantage of a country that is already struggling.

So far, Madonna has not commented on the criticisms leveled against her, but it is likely that she is aware of them. She has always been a controversial figure, and this latest move is sure to generate even more debate. While some people are happy that she is taking in more children, others feel that she should have left well enough alone and that there are already too many homeless children in the world.

#  Malawi votes to legalize gay rights

In a landmark victory for the LGBT+ community, Malawi has voted to legalize same-sex relationships.

This comes as a major turnaround for a country that only criminalized homosexuality in 2013. Since then, activists have campaigned tirelessly for equal rights, and on Tuesday, their efforts paid off.

“It’s been a long journey and we are overjoyed that our voices have finally been heard,” said Gift Trapence of the Centre for the Development of People (CEDEP), one of the organizations behind the campaign.

Under the new law, same-sex couples will now be able to hold hands in public, share property, and inherit from each other. They will also be protected from discrimination in areas such as employment and housing.

While there is still some way to go before full equality is achieved, this is a major step in the right direction. And with more countries around the world beginning to recognize same-sex relationships, there is hope that one day all members of the LGBT+ community will be treated equally under the law.

#  Malawi to decriminalize witchcraft

The southern African nation of Malawi is set to decriminalize witchcraft, a move that may signal a shift in the way the country deals with allegations of supernatural activity. The change, which was proposed by the Minister of Justice and constitutional affairs, airstrike on allegations that people practicing witchcraft are criminals.

“The intention is to protect people who have been accused of or been felt to be practicing witchcraft from being victimized,” said the spokesman for Malawi’s President Peter Mutharika. Witchcraft has long been seen as a criminal activity in Malawi, with those convicted often facing harsh penalties, including death. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of people accused of witchcraft, often leading to mob justice.

While it has not been made clear what will happen to those who have already been convicted of witchcraft, the change in legislation is seen as a step towards protecting vulnerable members of society. “It is about time that this law is repealed because it does not make sense to have it anymore,” said rights group Amnesty International in a statement. “This law has resulted in the violation of rights to freedom from discrimination, arbitrary arrest and torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment for many over the years.”

#  UNICEF warns of looming food crisis in Malawi

According to a recent report released by UNICEF, Malawi is facing a looming food crisis with up to 3.5 million people projected to be food insecure by early 2019. 

The report attributes the looming crisis to a number of factors, including erratic rainfall, floods, and drought. These have resulted in decreased crop production and livestock production, which has in turn led to increased food prices and malnutrition rates. 

The UNICEF report calls for urgent action to address the food crisis, including provision of assistance to those most in need, support for farmers and rural communities, and engagement of the private sector in food procurement. 

Malawi is not alone in facing a food crisis; similar crises are unfolding in countries across Africa and the Middle East. The UNICEF report urges global solidarity in addressing these crises, noting that "the world cannot afford to let any child go hungry."

#  IMF predicts 7% growth for Malawi in 2017

After years of economic turbulence, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that the Malawian economy will grow by 7% in 2017. This is welcome news for the country, which has been struggling to emerge from a period of political and economic turmoil.

The IMF’s report praised the government’s efforts to stabilise the economy, but warned that there were still risks that could affect growth. These include weather-related shocks (such as floods or droughts), as well as potential social unrest.

In order to ensure continued growth, the IMF recommended that the government focus on improving infrastructure, promoting private sector investment, and maintaining fiscal discipline. It also urged authorities to continue with reforms aimed at improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment.

Malawi has made significant progress since 2014, when it secured a bailout from the IMF worth $156 million. Inflation has been brought under control, and GDP growth was recorded at 5.3% in 2016. However, much remains to be done if Malawi is to achieve its goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2020.
