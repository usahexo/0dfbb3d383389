Who Makes Chips for Slot Machines at William Hill?

Slot machines are a popular game found in casinos around the world, and William Hill is no exception. Slot machines, like all casino games, rely on chips to represent and track a player's bets and winnings. But who makes the chips for William Hill's slot machines? 

William Hill is a well-known name in the gambling industry and offers a wide variety of casino games, including slot machines. The company is headquartered in London, England, and has been in operation for over 80 years. 

When it comes to the chips used in their slot machines, William Hill, like many other casinos, relies on specialized companies to create and distribute them. One such company is GPI (Gaming Partners International), a leading supplier of casino currency, gaming chips, and other related products.

GPI has been in business since 2002 and has a global presence with manufacturing facilities in Europe, Asia, and the United States. The company provides a wide range of products and services to casinos, including customized casino chips, RFID technology, and casino currency.

In addition to GPI, there are several other companies that specialize in creating chips for slot machines. These include Matsui Gaming Machine Co., Ltd, Abbiati Casino Equipment, and Bourgogne et Grasset. 

It's worth noting that the chips used in slot machines are different from the chips used in other casino games, such as blackjack or roulette. Slot machine chips are typically made of plastic and are designed to be easily counted and sorted by the machine.

In conclusion, while William Hill is a major player in the gambling industry, they rely on specialized companies like GPI to create the chips used in their slot machines. These companies have a wealth of experience and expertise in creating high-quality, customized casino currency and gaming chips that meet the needs of casinos around the world.
