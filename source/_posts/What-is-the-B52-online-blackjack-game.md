#  What is the B52 online blackjack game?

The B-52 online blackjack game is an interesting and exciting variation of the traditional blackjack game. The objective of the B-52 game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer, or by collecting a higher total value than the dealer without going over 21.

B-52 online blackjack can be played with one to eight decks of cards. In each deck, there are 52 cards (2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). The numbered cards are worth their face value, and the face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are each worth 10 points. An Ace can be counted as 1 point or 11 points, whichever produces the best result for the player.

Players are dealt two cards at the beginning of each hand. The player's goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer also receives two cards, but one is face down and one is face up. The face-up card is called the "up card" and gives players an idea of what kind of hand the dealer may have.

The player can either choose to "stand" with their current total or they can hit (take another card). If they go over 21 points with their additional card, they "bust" and lose that hand. If the Dealer goes over 21 points with their up card, all players still in the hand automatically win even if they have bust themselves. If the Dealer has a total of 17 or more points with their first two cards (an Ace and a six, for instance), they must hit unless they have a blackjack (a ten and an Ace).
