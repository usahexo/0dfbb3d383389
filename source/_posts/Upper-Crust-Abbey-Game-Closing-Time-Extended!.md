#  Upper Crust Abbey Game Closing Time Extended!

In response to the outcry from Upper Crust Abbey fans, the game's developers have decided to extend its closing time!

Originally, the game was supposed to close on October 1st, but due to the large number of players who have yet to finish it, the developers have pushed back the deadline.

"We've been closely monitoring player feedback and activity," said a spokesperson for the game's developers. "It's clear that many people are still enjoying themselves in Upper Crust Abbey and we want to give everyone as much time as possible to finish the game."

The new closing time is now November 15th.

#  Buffet closes at 10pm sharp!

You may be wondering why a buffet would close at 10pm sharp. There are a few reasons for this.

First, the restaurant wants to make sure that all of their guests have time to get their food and eat before the buffet closes. They don't want anyone feeling rushed or stressed out when they're trying to enjoy their meal.

Second, the restaurant wants to make sure that they have enough time to clean up properly before closing. This means that they can start preparing for the next day's meals and get the kitchen ready for the next group of guests.

Finally, the restaurant wants to make sure that they're following all of the local ordinances and regulations. Closing at 10pm is one way that they can ensure compliance with these rules.
